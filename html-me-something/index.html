  <h1>Andrew Lutz, LC101</h1>
</header><h3>
  <p>Andrew Lutz is wonderful fellow.  You see, after being educated by monks as a youth, he chose to dive in to the liberal world
    to truly put his world view to the test.   He entered Webster university with a scholarship, and worked at Bestbuy as a geek in the 
    newly christianed 'geek squad'.  Before long he was President of the computer club, and drinking much like an old toilet flushes.
    The rest is a story I will let you imagine.
  </p>
  <p>At some point, Andrew fled the world and joined a Benedictine monastery.  He looks great in black.  At least, that's what Isabelle 
    on the train from Rome to Florence thought.....  Well, back to the liberal world he returned; this time smiling</p>
  <p>Then, Andrew fled to Honolulu, where he was sold at market to the young island princess, Valeria di Mencias....  She owns him to this day.</p>
